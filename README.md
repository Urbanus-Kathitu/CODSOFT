For the Data Science internship, I was required to complete at least
3 tasks for successful completion of the internship.
Below are three of the Tasks I chose and how I tackled each to showcase my data science skills.

# Chosen Tasks:
**Task 1: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. See the full description of the project in the Task1 folder.

**Task 2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON**

Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based onfeatures like genre, director, and actors using regression techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

**Task 3: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**

Used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. Follow my walkthrough and the full description of the project in the Task 3 folder.
