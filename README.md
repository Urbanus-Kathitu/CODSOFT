For the Data Science internship, I was required to complete at least
3 tasks for successful completion of the internship.
Below are three of the Tasks I chose and how I tackled each to showcase my data science skills.

# Chosen Tasks:
**Task 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. See the full description of the project in the Task1 folder.

**Task 2: Sales Prediction Using Python**

Predicting future sales is crucial for businesses, and I delved into this realm by forecasting product purchases. Leveraging machine learning techniques in Python, I analyzed factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Explore the implementation in the Task 3 folder for insights.

**Task 3: Titanic Survival Prediction**

Used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. Follow my walkthrough and the full description of the project in the Task 3 folder.
